# programming_basics_practice
I would like to showcase with the below programs not that I am fluent in either of the libraries I used (except for the main part of "raw" python), but the fact that I can learn and can do projects with the help of documentation.

Different algorithms & small problems to practice python, the underlying logic and the use of libraries(to make the code more efficient);
Linear search, Binary search, Fibonacci-dynamic programming solution, blurring an image;
A small "to-do list" app, which aims to showcase that I can look up documentation and understand the logic of programming;
basic face recognition using cv2 library; 
speech recognition using speech_recognition library and regular expression;
merge sort;
twitter scraping with tweepy, saving the stream to JSON;
