AIM OF PRACTICE: practice working from documentation,
		 practice requesting data from a simple API, practice the powerful library "re", 
		 learn the most basic SQL commands, familiarize myself with a simple relational management database system,
		 general practice

REFLECTION: 	I could have made a more logical python file division, 
		I should use the writeline function instead of write function so that the text file is easier to read
